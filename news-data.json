Londoners are now banned from social meet-ups with friends and families in any indoor setting unless they live together or have formed a support bubble with them. Includes venues such as pubs and restaurants as well as private homes. However, the warnings appear to have fallen on deaf ears, while businesses in the city - already on the brink of closure due to the lockdown - say policing which households come in is not their job'. David Garcia, 45, operations manager of Arma, a Middle Eastern restaurant in Soho, central London, said he is not going to be the one to tell people to keep to their own household or refuse to serve them. There's been a direct and immediate impact,' he said. We were doing really well on weekends because the area was getting busier and now we are down 50 per cent from last week. When it came into place we took half of what we took last week."

The company is paying HK$28bn (£2.8bn) to raise its stake in Sun Art Retail Group, a hypermarket operator, from 21% to 72%. It will now seek to buy out the remaining shareholders in Sun Art, whose Hong Kong-listed shares shot up by 30% initially, afore closing up 19%. Advertisement Sun Art, which as at the terminus of June operated 481 hypermarkets and three mid-sized supermarkets, is China's second-most sizably voluminous grocery retailer and accounts for around 14% of the hypermarket sector on its own. The deal is consistent with the incipient retail strategy of Daniel Zhang, Alibaba's chairman and chief executive, of cumulating both e-commerce with physical retail."

Having struggled for years, Flybe was pushed into administration earlier this year as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged immensely colossal components of the peregrinate market. Even afore the pandemic commenced, in January the airline had narrowly eschewed administration. Flybe Europe's most immensely colossal regional airline collapsed on March 5 after months on the brink, triggering 2,400 job losses and leaving around 15,000 passengers stranded across the UK and Europe. Lamentably, with the situation that has developed with (coronavirus), an already impuissant company, I'm trepidacious, just hasn't been able to survive, convey secretary Grant Shapps verbally expressed at the time."

Deloitte announced that it will close its Nottingham office to move to working from home practices, affecting around 160 employees. Businesses in Mansfield Road, near the company's base in Woodborough Road, said the news comes as a blow to the industry which is already struggling. Ozkan Kaya, Manager at City Off License in Mansfield Road, said: We usually have a lot of office workers who come in here, so this will impact us. It is one of those problems which we have to live with at the moment. It will get better but it will take time. I don't blame Deloitte because it whatever the company feels is right for their employees. It is good to have the students here at the moment, without them it would be like a ghost town. Georgia Fyfe, who works at the Rose of England pub, said staying open is already a struggle for the business. The 23-year-old said: Nobody is coming into town now, people are spending their time at home. We are on the bus route and we usually get loads of people coming into town for a pint or two. This whole pandemic has caused too many issues and the government has put too many barriers in place for the hospitality industry. It makes it hard for people to come in."

The government has been consulting on a system where passengers would be tested after just a week of isolation. But BA's new boss wants testing before departure, not quarantine on arrival. Addressing an online aviation conference, Mr Shapps said the government was looking at introducing a virus test alongside a shortened quarantine period by early December. My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed a regime, based on a single test provided by the private sector and at the cost to the passenger, after a period of self-isolation, he said. The government's travel taskforce, which is working on the plans, will put its recommendations before the prime minister in November, Mr Shapps said. The idea is to reduce the amount of time travellers coming into the UK have to spend self-isolating - currently 14 days for those arriving from areas not included on the government's list of travel corridors."

        "content": "The education minister revealed the figure on the same day that schools began a two-week closure, aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. Mr Weir said the figure of 1,491 cases was the overall school population - taking in teachers, staff and students. It is a cumulative figure from 24 August to 13 October, he added The minister said there are about 333,000 students at schools in Northern Ireland and about 19,000 staff. He said the number of positive tests worked out at around 0.4% of the school population, which also means about one in every 250 pupils and staff members. The education minister said schools had mostly had cases of single individuals testing positive. In early September a Department of Education official told Stormont's education committee there had been 88 Covid-19 cases in 64 schools during the first two weeks of term. The education minister has now told assembly members there were 1,491 positive cases of individuals within schools during roughly the first seven weeks of term. But that statistic still leaves a lot of questions unanswered. How many individual schools have been affected and how many of those cases are pupils and how many are staff? How many schools have had to send pupils home to self-isolate for 14 days as a result of a positive case and how many pupils in total have been out of school for two weeks as a result? The latest attendance rate for pupils is 93.7% but those at home self-isolating are still marked as present if they're receiving work, so the rate tells us little about the level of disruption Covid-19 is causing in schools."

It shows a woman with a Scottish accent swearing and shouting everybody dies, you know that? as she picks up her bag and jacket while being ushered off. She apparently pretends to cough on passengers as she walks down the aisle. An Easyjet spokesman confirmed police were called on Sunday following an incident on flight EZY481 due to a passenger behaving disruptively onboard and refusing to wear their face covering. In line with EASA guidelines, all passengers are currently required to bring their own face covering for their flight which must be worn during boarding and onboard, except when eating or drinking, the spokesman added. Passengers receive clear communications before they travel and via announcements onboard to ensure they are aware of this requirement for the health and safety of everyone onboard. We will not tolerate disruptive behaviour towards other passengers and crew. A spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said airport police were called at around 16:35 on Sunday and the passenger was subsequently arrested and is currently under investigation."

        "content": "Shanghai authorities said the group had reported changes in the financial technology regulatory environment, leading to the suspension. The listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong would have been the biggest to date. Ant, backed by Jack Ma, billionaire founder of e-commerce platform Alibaba, was set to sell shares worth about $34.4bn (£26.5bn) on Thursday Ant runs Alipay, the main online payment system in China, where cash, cheques and credit cards have long been eclipsed by e-payment devices and apps. Alipay says the total volume of payments on its platforms in China for the year ending in June was $17.6tn. The online giant had planned to make its dual listing this week. However, Mr Ma and two top executives were asked to attend a meeting with financial regulators on Monday where they were told Ant's online lending business faces more government scrutiny, Reuters news agency reported. The Shanghai stock exchange said on Tuesday that major issues, including Ant's report of changes to the regulatory environment, meant Ant no longer met listing conditions or information disclosure requirements. The Hong Kong exchange then reported that Ant had decided to suspend its planned listing. The share price was set on Monday amid reports of very strong demand from major investors. Ant was due to sell about 11% of its shares. But the pricing valued the whole business at about $313bn. The previous largest debut was Saudi Aramco's $29.4bn float last December."

The machines scan shelves to ensure all items are in stock and prices are accurate. They are designed to help bricks-and-mortar stores compete with online retailers like Amazon and Alibaba. The robots have been in use in Walmart stores since 2017 as it moved towards more automation. This was one idea we tried in roughly 500 stores just as we are trying other ideas in additional stores, Walmart said in a statement. A precise inventory is also essential for Walmart’s increasingly popular pickup and delivery services. The company posted a massive $137.7bn (£107bn) in revenue last quarter, driven higher by a 97% surge across its e-commerce platforms during Covid-19 restrictions. With competition among retailers fierce, other companies have taken different approaches to automation. Online retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba have tried to drive efficiency by using robots at their warehouses. Amazon bought a robotics company in 2012 to drive efficiency in its fulfilment centres, where it now uses more than 200,000 robots. Walmart’s bricks-and-mortar rival Target has been more reluctant to use robots in its stores, preferring instead for customers to interact with humans."

China’s economy bounced back in the third quarter, the first major economy to do so, although the annual growth rate, of 4.9%, was slightly lower than economists had expected.

        "content": "Lucas Luke Allard of Mill Houses, King’s Lynn, died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) on March 14 last year, a day after being discharged. The 28-year-old had Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder which can cause heart issues. An inquest into his death began last year, when Norfolk Coroner’s Court heard Mr Allard had attended A&E on March 12, complaining of severe chest pains. He underwent a CT scan but, after the results were sent to the emergency department, Dr Masud Isham copied and pasted the wrong scan into Mr Allard’s file. The spinal scan, of another patient, showed no abnormalities and Dr Isham sent Mr Allard home at 2.10am on March 13. On the morning of March 14, when another consultant was reviewing scans, the mistake became apparent and it was discovered Mr Allard had an aortic aneurysm. He was rushed to QEH but collapsed at hospital that day. As the inquest continued on Monday, it was also revealed Dr Isham had referred to a second incorrect scan which belonged to Mr Allard but was from 2018 and showed no abnormalities. Providing evidence, doctors from QEH said the hospital was putting in place measures to prevent similar errors, such as upgrading its internal computer systems. Dr Jason Smith, a consultant radiologist at QEH, said it was undeniable that current systems were not user-friendly, while area coroner for Norfolk, Yvonne Blake, said Dr Isham had been completely flummoxed. Dr Smith added that, when abnormalities are found, radiologists must now telephone the doctor who requested a CT scan - rather than asking administrative staff to do so. A&E consultant, Dr Robert Florence, highlighted the potential effect of fatigue on Dr Isham, who finished his shift two-and-a-half hours later than scheduled. He speculated that Dr Isham was unlikely to have taken a break, adding that he was no longer allowed to finish beyond midnight. Ms Blake gave a narrative conclusion, stating: As Lucas was being transferred from wheelchair to bed, he suffered a cardiac arrest and all attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful. She said she was “satisfied” with action being taken by QEH regarding its internal system, but added: That was not the problem here. The problem came about in reading the wrong scan and Lucas being falsely reassured."

Neil Thompson, operations director at London Luton, said it was important to hear from the wider community. Airports are assigned holding zones, which are areas in the skies where planes can circle if they have to wait to come in to land. Luton and Stansted currently use zones above Royston, and above Sudbury in Suffolk, at about 8,000ft. Lee Boulton, from NATS, a firm which provides air traffic services for Luton, said: The number of flights into Luton has increased significantly in recent years and our controllers have had to delay aircraft and manually manage each flight to ensure safety. This proposal is all about ensuring safety and the consultation is a great opportunity for people to give us their feedback and help shape the proposed options, so that the airspace around the airport operates more effectively."

But any financial help we get from the government is very welcome. Mr Attfield said mothballing the business had been easier this time around. He said: It’s more straightforward because we’ve done it before. But from an emotional and personal perspective of course, it’s still complicated. At least this time we understand the furlough scheme. Back in the spring, we thought we were telling people they were losing their jobs. Despite this, he said the government’s decision to ban takeaway alcohol sales from pubs was a “big frustration. During the first lockdown, takeaways provided a viable income stream for many of our pubs, he said. And if I’m being honest, I think it provided sanity for our publicans. We’re still waiting for clarification on a lot of points – but from previous experience, we know it can sometimes come two or three days later."
